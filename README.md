## Getting a readable version

The information in this repository is stored in Markdown format. If you prefer a more legible version, you can "compile" it in order to generate an html file that can be viewed in any browser.

You need a command line and [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) in order to generate the output in a format different than Markdown.

It may be also needed [pdflatex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PdfTeX) or an alternative pdf engine to generate pdf files.

### Generating readable formats

Just execute the following command
```
./build
```
This will generate a readable version of the contents of this repository in a directory called `tmp`. It will contain files: `0000000000-id_vision.XX` with a timestamp mark of the time when the file was generated and `LATEST-id_vision.XX` with the latest version of the file.
