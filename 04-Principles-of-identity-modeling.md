# Principles of identity modeling

- **Persons are the paramount element of identity systems**: Either directly or indirectly, identity systems relate to people. This makes it unavoidable to manage the information with the utmost respect to the ethical and regulatory concerns. From a practical perspective, even when the entity object of the work are not persons (e.g. an application for Role definition improving), the chances of missing the true point of the work are much higher if we remove people from the equation.
- **Reality over utopia**: Do not force identities into accommodate your model. Expand your model to accommodate them.
- **Reading and reconciling over writing and controlling**: Watch the status of the identities and ask for information about why do they look the way they do. Do not try to impose restrictions until you understand the nature of the identities in a particular context. **TODO** link to the inner-outer company video and explain its principles.
- **A static repository schema is never enough**: It does not matter how much time you take into analysing and understanding current needs of a system. When a system goes live and reality knocks to the door of the system designers, options are making reality fit into your model (which is discussed in its own principle), or helping your model fit into the reality.
- **Entity relationships are the true source of value**: Just in the same way as characters in a novel are nothing but a description until they interact with the rest of the entities in the world, the value of entities in a system is nothing compared to the value of their relationships. **TODO** Exemplify this.
- **Identities change over time**: Change is one of the few constants in the universe. This is also true for entities. Creating a model or a system that thinks of entities as something that does not change over time is going to become a problem at some point. Even if the work relates to historical information, it is possible to find elements of information that enhance existing entities, or it may be our understanding of the entities that change. In either case, entity-related systems should acknowledge for entity updating.
- **Specific purpose for information elicitation**: Apart from regulatory-related needs (e.g. GDPR), this principle states the need for separating different uses of the identity information. In the same way as it is unethical to sell to third parties information that has been requested for sending company notifications, it is unethical to use for marketing purposes information that is elicited for fraud prevention (or vice versa).
- **Not all entities are concrete**: In security, it is common to use specific information about an identity as the sole component for identity systems (e.g. a user requires an account in order to access a system). In marketing it is much more common to work with profiles of customers instead of specific customers. This difference is not as much related to the context (security vs marketing) as it is related to the purpose of the work. Just as marketing often work with actual specific customers to understand reality and create better abstractions (profiles), it must be common practice to analyse concrete subjects (e.g. cybersecurity criminals) in order to create attacker profiles and use those profiles for planning actions and countermeasures. This is currently a trend in cybersecurity which should be encouraged.
