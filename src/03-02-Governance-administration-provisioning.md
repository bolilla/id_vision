# Identity Governance, administration, provisioning and reconciliation

TODO expand
- This applies mostly to internal identities
- Management of provisioning, reconciliation and discrepancies; cascade updating, enabling, disabling, etc
- IoT identities, systems / service identities
- Workflows
- Concept "if you manage it, you get its problems" (e.g. management of the entitlements of a system in the centralised IDM)
- Identity governance and optimisation
- Recertification
- User cloning
- The importance of storing the reason for a change. This applies to the iteration of information enrichment (required for right to be forgotten), manual role assignment (who did it is in audit logs, but the reason may be forgotten at some point), automatic role assignment (a user may have a certain role for two different reasons: because a former boss requested it, and because current department provides it).
- Definition of the identity governance model
  + Iterative and incremental (versus the typical POV stated as "I can only get budget once")
  + Applies to "from scratch" as well as "well stablished" systems, as well as "we have something" and "we know it is much too complex".
- Authorisation management: based on "centralised control vs distribution and audit" section
  + Add comparison of OIDC (scopes based) Vs XACML (authorisation in the operation request)
- Identity governance as agility enabler
  + Base it on "centralised vs distribution"
  + Self service (expand in the "centralised vs distribution" section)
- Transparency in the identity governance processes, responsibilities, implications and risks
  + SoD analysis based on entitlements and systems (not roles)
  + Cloning users
- Good job is seldom recognized
- iterating analysis of the identity because of
  + New information received
  + Information deleted (right to be forgotten)
- Role mining
