# ... and so much more ...

There are too many identity themes to expand, and I have not yet had time to discuss them all. Here is a little list of what could be expanded (you can think about it as an assorted "to-do list" of pending sections for this document):

- Iterating and optimising identity information
  + Iterating on non-authorisation information
  + Identity governance and optimisation
  + Recertification
  + Iterating analysis of the identity because of
    * New information received
    * Information deleted (right to be forgotten)
- The importance of storing the reason for a change. This applies to the iteration of information enrichment (required for right to be forgotten), manual role assignment (who did it is in audit logs, but the reason may be forgotten at some point), automatic role assignment (a user may have a certain role for two different reasons: because a former boss requested it, and because current department provides it).
- Definition of the identity governance model
  + Iterative and incremental (versus the typical POV stated as "I can only get budget once")
  + Applies to companies where it has to be done "from scratch" as well as companies with "well stablished" processes and systems, as well as those that say "we have something" and "we know it is much too complex".
- SoD (Segregation of Duties) analysis based on entitlements and systems (not roles). Possibly relate this kind of relationship to the discussions about dependences in the book "Clean architecture".
- Role mining and the relationship between accepting a new entitlement combination with no semantic meaning, and the use of [PCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) (Principal Component Analysis) in machine learning.
- Auditing and compliance proving
- Discuss about PAM (Privileged Access Management) and how it is just an extension of the rest of the identity management schema, the authorisation model and the only special thing it has regards to access management and auditing.
- AI, machine learning, big data and numeric analysis as tools for data exploring and enrichment / iterating
- Possible use of the identity information for UX: personalisation of the user interface (e.g. show the same controls in the mobile version as in the desktop version for users who "come from" the desktop)
- Solutions for the problems of today Vs solutions for the problems of tomorrow.
  + Deep dive in the false sense of comfort when we design a solution for all current problems, backed up by the arrogance of thinking we already know the full set of challenges the future will bring.
  + Analyse the use of standard solutions as a common solution for the problems and go beyond, making a stand for complex solutions that enable adaptability in the future (e.g. XACML Vs hardcoded policies). Base it in the concept of intelligence "maintaining options open for the future"
- Concept "you build it, you run it" and the impact of the DevOps culture in the classical IAM culture: project decomposition, implementation, iteration, etc.
- Explain the idea beyond Self-sovereign identity: returning the ownership of the identities to the people involved, how privacy should not be an [historical anomaly](https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/20/googles-cerf-says-privacy-may-be-an-anomaly-historically-hes-right/?guccounter=1).
- Identity relationships will have an exponential [attention](https://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/IRM/) increase, and that's good.
