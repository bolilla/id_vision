# Company relationship with identities

Coming from an identity background, I accept my opinion regarding this subject may be biased. End-of-disclaimer.

## Identity driven organisation

So far, it is common practice to hear statements associating identity with security. These statements sound like "Let's put identity at the heart of security" or "Identity is the new perimeter". We have "Identiy driven security".

In some companies, Security discipline has begun shifting from a cost to a business enabler. So should happen with the Identity discipline. In my opinion identity should guide the organisation decisions. It may sound na√Øve, but the longer I think about the decisions being made in a company, the more I think they relate to people. Of course it is people who have to take action and endure the consequences of the decisions, but the decisions themselves are very much associated to people: the cost of the salaries of the people working for the company, the assets of the people who have trusted the company with their assets, the markets are a reflection of the societies.

From my perspective, all actors are entities and have identities, which can be modelled, profiled, quantified and managed. Those identities are the forces of nature of the universe of the companies.

## Relationship with the identity community

Identity management is a complex subject and is full of moving targets. As the whole company relates to identities (at least because they use user accounts to access the tools they use on a daily basis), identity initiatives are extremely complex from both the human-political and the technical perspective.

When an identity position is set up, it is extremely difficult to cover. I have been selected for positions which have been open for more than half a year with no suitable candidate (not sure if that means I am very valuable or that the companies were desperate ;) ). I would say that in most cases, there is no suitable individual with all the required knowledge, experience and skills. That is the reason because the community is so important.

One of the most difficult things to find out when working in identity is this: "You are not alone". Even when the size of the identity community cannot compare to software development or agile practitioners (or star wars fans), there is a community working hard on helping each other. When asking a question to a fellow identity professional I have never received any kind of RTFM-like answer; most probably because there is no such manual!

When a company wants to be proficient in anything, it has to have talent related to that "anything". In the case of identities, it should be part of the community.

The identity-related communities seem to me extremely welcoming.

I will differentiate two kinds (even when they are related): standards committees and working groups on one hand, and professional associations on the other one.

### Working groups and standardisation committees

There is major ongoing work relating identities. For just a sample of this (BlockChain and SmartContracts, User Managed Access, etc), you can check [Kantara's groups](https://kantarainitiative.org/groups/). These work is being made by people who are passionate about identities and their problems, and the outcome of this work is going to shape the way companies relate to identities worldwide and the

When discussing about standards Vs ad hoc, the dimension that is often missed is the one regarding the influence in the standards committees in order to expand the standards to cover the needs of the company.

### Professional associations

There are very few professional associations focused on the digital identity topic. I think this makes these associations much more welcoming and much more valuable.

One of these associations is [ID Pro](https://idpro.org/). An organisation of recent creation composed by top level professionals from all around the globe (and mostly from USA).

Beyond specific benefits, such as the typical early access to relevant information, and professional opinions about identity situations, belonging to such a community aids into shaping the future of identities.

### What does "belonging to the community mean"

Communities are composed of people. This people are passionate about them and dedicate a significant part of their energy and time to those communities.

When I say a company should be part of the community I mean it should (in addition to paying whichever fees that may be involved) encourage members of the organisation to devote part of their working time to the identity community.

It is not enough for a company to hire passionate professionals and expect them to contribute their spare time to influence the community.

## Who should guide the relationship of the company with the identities?
When companies state they focus on people, they do so either regarding their [paying] customers, their employees or the society. The third case is on purpose ambiguous, so I'll leave it apart. Regarding the other two, we already have the tools to manage (in the best possible way) the information about them that we have.

In most cases, when a company [truly] wants to push an initiative or behaviour in the company, they adjust the organisation chart and provide the budget they see fit.

If a company wants to push the identity initiatives, a figure must be appointed. As to the job title in the badge, to whom should she report and what is the size of the team, that is as difficult to say as it would be to set the priorities of that team. It depends on the company.

One of the options could be naming a Chief Identity Officier, but may be the CXF is already too crowded. There is a good discussion about this [here](https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kearns/do-you-need-an-identity-officer "Do you need an Identity Officer?").

In my opinion the role described in the former article misses a huge part of the picture. Even when I think it would be useful to have a figure leading internal identity initiatives related to employees, as discussed in the identity classification section, there are much much more than employees when dealing with identities. Customer Identity and Access Management is a discipline in itself, ant that only covers a small portion of the relationship of a company with the customers. If we add identity profiles for customer segments, competence, fraudsters, cyberattackers, regulators and other actors that the company needs to deeply understand, the task is no piece or cake.

The reason for all these things relating (at least partially) to one role is twofold: it would provide coherence to the efforts of profiling identities, applying AI, managing consents, etc; but more importantly, the role would be able to push the coherence of the identities and their identifiers across the whole organisation.

### The Identity Team

TODO What it is and what it does, and what it does not do (e.g. it does not manage all the identities).

- Define global authorisation model
- Define global identity management model
- Define global rules regarding data retention, recertification and any other regulatory compliance matter
- Define global rules for SoD
- Define global rules for
- Their reality is not the system that holds or uses the identities, but the policies in the organisation
- Implement non-intrusive means to check correctness of the systems
- Provide tools for management as simple as possible

TODO expand [Alberto Partida](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9789048188819) assimilates it to the blue team, but I disagree.

TODO ask for a rainbow colour for the identity team. Possibly Aqua from the (rainbow series)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Series].


## Compliance is not enough

TODO

- Compliance Vs Security
  + Recertifications
  + Centralised knowledge of local information
- Compliance with stated regulatory compliance is not enough. It is required to make our behaviour with customers and employees the de-facto standard, pushing expectations of users beyond regulatory compliance to a place where we have no competence.
