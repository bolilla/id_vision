# Company relationship with identities

Coming from an identity background, I accept my opinion regarding this subject may be biased. End-of-disclaimer.

## Identity driven organisation

So far, it is common practice to hear statements associating identity with security. These statements sound like "Let's put identity at the heart of security" or "Identity is the new perimeter". We have "Identiy driven security".

In some companies, Security discipline has begun shifting from a cost to a business enabler. So should happen with the Identity discipline. In my opinion identity should guide the organisation decisions. It may sound na√Øve, but the longer I think about the decisions being made in a company, the more I think they relate to people. Of course it is people who have to take action and endure the consequences of the decisions, but the decisions themselves are very much associated to people: the cost of the salaries of the people working for the company, the assets of the people who have trusted the company with their assets, the markets are a reflection of the societies.

From my perspective, all actors are entities and have identities, which can be modelled, profiled, quantified and managed. Those identities are the forces of nature of the universe of the companies.

### Servant leadership of identity management

I truly believe identities should lead businesses, and proper identity management is a key factor in business, as identities include employees, customers, partners, competitors, threats and other stakeholders (which shape the context for the decision making).

A good (marvellous) approach to identity management is almost invisible. Things happen the way This leads to one of the common pitfalls in identity strategy definition: it does not provide visibility.

If there is a place for [servant leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership), it is in identity management.

Identities (and their relationships) will shape the future of businesses, but the management of those identities will happen underneath the surface. I have never seen an interview to the project manager of an identity initiative explaining how valuable his contribution has been for the company success, no matter how well (or bad) the project went.


## Relationship with the identity community

Identity management is a complex subject and is full of moving targets. As the whole company relates to identities (at least because they use user accounts to access the tools they use on a daily basis), identity initiatives are extremely complex from both the human-political and the technical perspective.

When an identity position is set up, it is extremely difficult to cover. I have been selected for positions which have been open for more than half a year with no suitable candidate (not sure if that means I am very valuable or that the companies were desperate ;) ). I would say that in most cases, there is no suitable individual with all the required knowledge, experience and skills. That is the reason because the community is so important.

One of the most difficult things to find out when working in identity is this: "You are not alone". Even when the size of the identity community cannot compare to software development or agile practitioners (or star wars fans), there is a community working hard on helping each other. When asking a question to a fellow identity professional I have never received any kind of RTFM-like answer; most probably because there is no such manual!

When a company wants to be proficient in anything, it has to have talent related to that "anything". In the case of identities, it should be part of the community.

The identity-related communities seem to me extremely welcoming.

I will differentiate two kinds (even when they are related): standards committees and working groups on one hand, and professional associations on the other one.

### Working groups and standardisation committees

There is major ongoing work relating identities. For just a sample of this (BlockChain and SmartContracts, User Managed Access, etc), you can check [Kantara's groups](https://kantarainitiative.org/groups/). These work is being made by people who are passionate about identities and their problems, and the outcome of this work is going to shape the way companies relate to identities worldwide and the

When discussing about standards Vs ad hoc, the dimension that is often missed is the one regarding the influence in the standards committees in order to expand the standards to cover the needs of the company.

### Professional associations

There are very few professional associations focused on the digital identity topic. I think this makes these associations much more welcoming and much more valuable.

One of these associations is [ID Pro](https://idpro.org/). An organisation of recent creation composed by top level professionals from all around the globe (and mostly from USA).

Beyond specific benefits, such as the typical early access to relevant information, and professional opinions about identity situations, belonging to such a community aids into shaping the future of identities.

### What does "belonging to the community mean"

Communities are composed of people. This people are passionate about them and dedicate a significant part of their energy and time to those communities.

When I say a company should be part of the community I mean it should (in addition to paying whichever fees that may be involved) encourage members of the organisation to devote part of their working time to the identity community.

It is not enough for a company to hire passionate professionals and expect them to contribute their spare time to influence the community.

## Who should guide the relationship of the company with the identities?
When companies state they focus on people, they do so either regarding their [paying] customers, their employees or the society. The third case is on purpose ambiguous, so I'll leave it apart. Regarding the other two, we already have the tools to manage (in the best possible way) the information about them that we have.

In most cases, when a company [truly] wants to push an initiative or behaviour in the company, they adjust the organisation chart and provide the budget they see fit.

If a company wants to push the identity initiatives, a figure must be appointed. As to the job title in the badge, to whom should she report and what is the size of the team, that is as difficult to say as it would be to set the priorities of that team. It depends on the company.

One of the options could be naming a Chief Identity Officier, but may be the CXF is already too crowded. There is a good discussion about this [here](https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kearns/do-you-need-an-identity-officer "Do you need an Identity Officer?").

In my opinion the role described in the former article misses a huge part of the picture. Even when I think it would be useful to have a figure leading internal identity initiatives related to employees, as discussed in the identity classification section, there are much much more than employees when dealing with identities. Customer Identity and Access Management is a discipline in itself, ant that only covers a small portion of the relationship of a company with the customers. If we add identity profiles for customer segments, competence, fraudsters, cyberattackers, regulators and other actors that the company needs to deeply understand, the task is no piece or cake.

The reason for all these things relating (at least partially) to one role is twofold: it would provide coherence to the efforts of profiling identities, applying AI, managing consents, etc; but more importantly, the role would be able to push the coherence of the identities and their identifiers across the whole organisation.

### The Identity Team

The identity team is the set of people whose primary concern are identities and their management. Both concerns are much broader than IT system accounts and both concepts encompass much more than "doing the things".

The identity team is accountable for the definition of the global authorisation model, the global identity management model and setting the rules regarding data retention, permission recertification, segregation of duties and any other regulatory considerations. They are also accountable for the abiding of those rules, but they are not necessarily accountable for implementing all the mechanisms that support identities.

The identity team should set up as little mechanisms as possible for the management and as many mechanisms as required for the auditing and validation of the defined rules. This way of working allows the identity team to be a contributor to the company without becoming a bottleneck and a stopper for the rest of the teams.

The focus of this team is not the operation of the IDM and the implementation of workflows or generating reports about identities, but the identity policies that help the company meeting regulations and doing business.

Some authors such as [Alberto Partida](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9789048188819) assimilates the identity team to the [blue team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_team_(computer_security)) (the team that ensures security), but I disagree. I think identities are much more than security, and security is much more than identities.

If there is a colour for the identity team I think Aqua from the (rainbow series)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Series] is a good option.

## Compliance is not enough

Isaas Asimov via his character Salvor Hardin said "Never let your sense of morals prevent you from doing what is right!". Well, regarding compliance you may have similar disjunctives.

Compliance to regulations is mandatory, and compliance to standards is a good practice. The way compliance is achieved is where the devil resides.

It is possible to achieve compliance in many ways, and some of them are equally valid from a compliance point of view, but very different from a strategic point of view.

When a new system is added into the card payment process, it has to be [PCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard) compliant. That is good. What could not be so good is to decide that the system should not be created because going through PCI is "too much work". In identities, similar situations arise.

In my opinion, compliance should not be the objective, but the bare minimum.

TODO

- Compliance Vs Security
  + Recertifications
  + Centralised knowledge of local information
- Compliance with stated regulatory compliance is not enough. It is required to make our behaviour with customers and employees the de-facto standard, pushing expectations of users beyond regulatory compliance to a place where we have no competence.

## Standard based Vs Ad hoc is the new Build or Buy

Whenever a new initiative arises there is always the (healthy) discussion about whether the company should build the solution or buy a COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) solution (and most probably heavily customise).

I cannot discuss pros and cons of each approach in this document; I'll just focus on saying that regarding identities, when this discussion arises, it shows an identity strategy that could have been done better.

COTS products provide implementations of the standards, easier integration with other products of the same vendor, plus custom functionalities that have been requested by previous customers or envisioned by the vendor themselves. Ad hoc developments provide all needed flexibility to address current needs.

A truly strategic vision of identities should be such that the standards that COTS solutions implement cover the needs of the company. That way, implementing or buying is not a matter of adaptation of current needs, but a matter of time and cost, plus the ability to being prepared for future challenges.

Having such a vision is certainly difficult, but not having it costs literally millions of euros in personalisation of COTS, building of ad hoc pieces ... and doing it all over again at every disruptive change in IT (every 5 years or so).
