# The use of an identity

We know what is an identity, but in order to expand its meaning and its qualities, it is imperative to understand what are we going to do with it.

Even when the actual objective of the work with identities belong to the worker, and this document cannot cover them all, let's classify operations in five different categories:

- Obtaining identity information
- Identity information storing and making available
- Identity lifecycle management
- Identity information improvement
- Identity information retrieval for actual company uses

Only one of the five categories is directly related to getting value from the identity information we have. May be that is one of the reasons why it is sometimes so difficult to use the information when it is needed: because it was not sufficiently elicitated, because it is not properly stored or not properly available, because it is not current or up-to-date, or because the information is too raw to make use of it.

TODO explain each of the categories with examples
TODO create a graph depicting the categories
TODO add identity federation as an example of information improvement
TODO Information about entitlements of a system inside the an IDM (corporate or specific for the application)
TODO expand Implementing ABAC when the model is RBAC makes no sense
TODO Authorisation in microservice architectures (OIDC Vs XACML)
TODO Segregation of duties based on entitlement information or entitlement-system or system-system to prevent problems when roles change. Possibly relate this to dependency diagrams in "Clean architecture".

## Actions resulting from the authorisation

TODO Resulting actions after the evaluation of an authorisation may be very diverse (ok/ko/whatever the application may require). The thin and grey line between security authorisation and business logic.
