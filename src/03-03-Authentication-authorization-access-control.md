# Authentication, authorisation and access control

TODO expand
- EAM
- Modifications to the requested operation (e.g. modifying sql queries)
- SSO and flexibility in this concept (tokens vs browser plugins). It is mandatory to do it as well as possible.
- PAM
TODO Authorisation in microservice architectures (OIDC Vs XACML)

- Authorisation management: based on "centralised control vs distribution and audit" section
  + Add comparison of OIDC (scopes based) Vs XACML (authorisation in the operation request)

## Actions resulting from the authorisation

TODO Resulting actions after the evaluation of an authorisation may be very diverse (ok/ko/whatever the application may require). The thin and grey line between security authorisation and business logic.
