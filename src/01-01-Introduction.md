# Digital Identity in banking: a personal vision

My name is Borja Roux and this document contains my own personal vision about digital identities, its management, its value and its use in a banking environment.

It shows a situation that may be far away from current status for most companies at the moment, and that is one of the purposes of this work.

Why would anyone write (or read) a vision that is close to current reality?

- Account: a record of an identity in a system. Enables the access to the actions performed by the system.
- Orphan Account: account that is not known to be tied to any person.
- Privileged Account: account with special (administrative) privileges. May be associated to specific person or may be anonymous.
- Identity Federation: Linking information about an identity from different sources ([according to wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_identity)). This term is used extensively in the context of SSO, but it is not exclusive to it. The value of linking identity information from different sources goes much beyond an easy login.
