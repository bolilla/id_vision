# Iterating on the information and optimisation
TODO

- Iterating on non-authorisation information
- Identity governance and optimisation
- Recertification
- The importance of storing the reason for a change. This applies to the iteration of information enrichment (required for right to be forgotten), manual role assignment (who did it is in audit logs, but the reason may be forgotten at some point), automatic role assignment (a user may have a certain role for two different reasons: because a former boss requested it, and because current department provides it).
- Definition of the identity governance model
  + Iterative and incremental (versus the typical POV stated as "I can only get budget once")
  + Applies to "from scratch" as well as "well stablished" systems, as well as "we have something" and "we know it is much too complex".
- SoD analysis based on entitlements and systems (not roles). Possibly relate this to dependency diagrams in "Clean architecture".
- iterating analysis of the identity because of
  + New information received
  + Information deleted (right to be forgotten)
- Role mining
