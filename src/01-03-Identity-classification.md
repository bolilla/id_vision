# Identity-classification

TODO XXX expand categories. Begin by saying this is not (just) about IAM Vs CIAM; this includes identities for whatever is important for the company.

## Concrete
known and concise. e.g. Active Directory account

## Integrated or Aggregated
Identity information merged from the aggregation of different sources of information. e.g. crossing employee records and customer records

## Fragmented
Identity with missing information. e.g. some identityes have name and email and telephone, some have name and telephone and some have just email.

## Profiled
Profile defined from different sources of information. e.g. haccker profile definition, regulator psicological profile, market segmentation, etc

## Projected
Identity created with a subset of the information about another identity. e.g. email account created based on the information in HR system.

## Inferred

- Focused on identity relationships
- composing information based on id
- inferring information based on simmilar identities
- iterating analysis of the identity because of
  + New information received
  + Information deleted (right to be forgotten)

## Identity dimensions

### Completitude
All information about the id or just a little bit

### Reliability
How trustworthy is the information about the identity

### Fragmentation
How many sources of information have we used to get the final identity
