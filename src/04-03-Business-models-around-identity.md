# Business models around the identity

There are many business models around identities and I don't feel like drawing [Business Model Canvasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas). I've done it in the past and I can tell it is fun, but for this document I will just focus the discussion on the differential value of the banking sector regarding identities.

I think the differential value that banking can provide can be summarised as:

- Thorough enrolment: banks know their customers very well (at least as much as [regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer) require)
- Fine tuned processes for defaulter/fraudster/thief identification and management: this is something banks have been doing for a really long time

Of course there are also many other identity-related assets that can provide big value, but if I had to choose two assets I would select the previous two. With other assets I am referring for example to financial information, market information, proximity to the customers, large customer bases, etc.

Once we know what is the value, we have to fill the rest of the canvas. This is something I'll leave to the imagination of the reader with just a few suggestions about options when a customer wants to pay for something in a "shop":

- The customer pays for the use of the banking identifier
- The shop pays for enabling the users to use their banking identities instead of social network identities
- The shop may trust higher transactions made by personally identified users
- The bank could back the identity of the users and claim it is not a fraudster
- The bank could add customer information (e.g. credit score) for the shop to decide payment options (which could also be contracted with the bank itself)

Of course there are the "typical" models around the information enrichment, selling, reporting and the like, but those are not so much levered on the differential value of a banking institution.
