# Standard based Vs Ad hoc is the new Build or Buy

Whenever a new initiative arises there is always the (healthy) discussion about whether the company should build the solution or buy a COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) solution (and most probably heavily customise).

I cannot discuss pros and cons of each approach in this document; I'll just focus on saying that regarding identities, when this discussion arises, it shows an identity strategy that could have been done better.

COTS products provide implementations of the standards, easier integration with other products of the same vendor, plus custom functionalities that have been requested by previous customers or envisioned by the vendor themselves. Ad hoc developments provide all needed flexibility to address current needs.

A truly strategic vision of identities should be such that the standards that COTS solutions implement cover the needs of the company. That way, implementing or buying is not a matter of adaptation of current needs, but a matter of time and cost, plus the ability to being prepared for future challenges.

Having such a vision is certainly difficult, but not having it costs literally millions of euros in personalisation of COTS, building of ad hoc pieces ... and doing it all over again at every disruptive change in IT (every 5 years or so).
