# About centralised control and how it compares to distributed management and auditing

It is very common to discuss governance in terms of centralisation vs distribution. Instead of offering a simple answer, I'd like to provide the dimensions that should be analysed for decision making.

In this particular case, I am referring to identities and their information, but the same approach could be used for other scenarios.

Even when there may be a grey scale between a fully centrally controlled system and a fully distributed one, I'll analyse them as complete alternatives.

## Who is the owner of the information?

In this context ownership I means liability. Another way of stating this question is: Who is going to suffer when a mistake is made regarding this information. The mistake will always happen at some point; it may be disclosure, failing keeping the information to update, lack of availability, etc. Suffering may mean different things: paying a fee for violating a regulation, managing sues from upset customers, delaying a commitment, etc.

If the owner of the information is an specific actor, probably the management of that information could be made in a centralised way. If some of the liabilities refer to different actors, we probably should have a shared control over the information.

## Relevance over agility

This tradeoff refers to the balance between the possible consequences of a proper management of the information versus the need to manage it in a speedy way.

If the information is truly relevant (e.g. it enables financial fraud or exposes the company to regulatory sanctions), speeding up the information management process may be not so important, and a centralised management system may be used.

If the information is not extremely relevant for the company (e.g. updating the physical address of a customer), the operations may be done in a distributed way.

## The difference between centralised controlling and centralised auditing

Centralised controlling of information enables the decision making for every single situation that may happen. This means that the control is exercised on a case-per-case basis. All actions taken have been validated by the centralised system.

Centralised auditing of information (without centralised control) delegates the decision making to external (not part of the centralised one) parties. In this case, auditing is set up so that the centralised system is able to know the details about the status of the information. Actions are taken without the knowledge of the centralised system; only corrective actions may be taken, and these happen after-the-fact.

In the first case, the creation of guidelines for the decision making is a good practice that helps with the job, but is not mandatory. In the second case, it is mandatory to set a framework for the work of the external parties. Without that framework, there would only be personal (individual) opinions.
