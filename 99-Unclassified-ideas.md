- Discussion "standards vs ad hoc". Relate to NSPRs.

- Repository integration and the importance of identifiers

- Identity governance and optimisation

- AI, machine learning, big data and numeric analysis as tools for data exploring and enrichment / iterating

- The importance of storing the reason for a change. This applies to the iteration of information enrichment (required for right to be forgotten), manual role assignment (who did it is in audit logs, but the reason may be forgotten at some point), automatic role assignment (a user may have a certain role for two different reasons: because a former boss requested it, and because current department provides it).

- Compliance with stated regulatory compliance is not enough. It is required to make our behaviour with customers and employees the de-facto standard, pushing expectations of users beyond regulatory compliance to a place where we have no competence.

- Monetising identity information (while being respectful with the reculations)
  - Why does it have value?
  - Business model to be defined:
    - Customer pays
    - Shop pays
    - Discount and cost shared between customer and shop
    - Fraud insurance

- Possible use of the identity information: personalisation of the UX (e.g. show the same controls in the mobile version as in the desktop version for users who "come from" the desktop)

- Solutions for the problems of today Vs solutions for the problems of tomorrow + analysis of the intelligence concept as "maintaining options open for the future"

- Definition of the identity governance model
  + Iterative and incremental (versus the typical POV stated as "I can only get budget once")
  + Applies to "from scratch" as well as "well stablished" systems, as well as "we have something" and "we know it is much too complex".

- Authorisation management: based on "centralised control vs distribution and audit" section
  + Add comparison of OIDC (scopes based) Vs XACML (authorisation in the operation request)

- Identity governance as agility enabler
  + Base it on "centralised vs distribution"
  + Self service (expand in the "centralised vs distribution" section)

- Transparency in the identity governance processes, responsibilities, implications and risks
  + SoD analysis based on entitlements and systems (not roles)
  + Cloning users

- Storing the reasons for the modifications of the entitlements (either automatic (plus reason), finger based, self-requested, etc)

- Write a couple of paragraphs about the silver bullet syndrome to explain the limitations of any tool or resource (such as centralised-automatic provisioning based on business rules applied on HR information, or the use of MAC/RBAC/XXX)

- Explain why it is necessary to have a complex authorisation model: because it is the framework, just as the law is the framework and not all articles apply to all activities all of the time. We should use the simplest subset of the model in every case. We should simplify it as much as possible, but no further (I think it is based on Einstein's quote).

- SSO and flexibility in this concept (tokens vs browser plugins). It is mandatory to do it as well as possible.

- Management of provisioning, reconciliation and discrepancies

- Concept "you build it, you run it"

- Concept "if you manage it, you get its problems" (e.g. management of the entitlements of a system in the centralised IDM)

- Compliance Vs Security
  + Recertifications
  + Centralised knowledge of local information

- Identity should be a business enabler as IT has already become, and security is becoming

- Identity modeling
  + What: Behaviour Vs Psychology / Philosophy
  + Interests / objectives
  + Natural propension => Deviation => Psychological condition => Unimputable
  Difference between sociopath and psychopath

- About returning the ownership of the identities to the people involved
