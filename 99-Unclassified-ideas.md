- Scope of the identities: all the company. We should be an identity-driven organisation. Of course beyond security, but also beyond it and beyond marketing.

- Discussion "standards vs ad hoc"

- Repository integration and the importance of identifiers

- Identity governance and optimisation

- AI, machine learning, big data and numeric analysis as tools for data exploring and enrichment / iterating

- The importance of storing the reason for a change. This applies to the iteration of information enrichment (required for right to be forgotten), manual role assignment (who did it is in audit logs, but the reason may be forgotten at some point), automatic role assignment (a user may have a certain role for two different reasons: because a former boss requested it, and because current department provides it).

- Relationship with identity community (among other things):
  - In case standards do not server our purposes, influence standardisation committees by participating in them. This means paying company fees plus paying employees to contribute to the community during working hours as part of their role in the company.
  - Communities to watch and contribute to
    - Kantara initiative
    - ID PRO

- Compliance with stated regulatory compliance is not enough. It is required to make our behaviour with customers and employees the de-facto standard, pushing expectations of users beyond regulatory compliance to a place where we have no competence.
